# Team Guide: Gong to Follow-up Email Workflow

## Overview
This guide shows you how to use the sales dashboard to automatically generate follow-up emails from Gong call transcripts.

## The Workflow (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Select or Create an Account
1. Navigate to **Account Management** module from the home page
2. Select an existing account OR click "Add Account" to create a new one
3. Make sure you're viewing the account you want to add a transcript to

### Step 2: Import Transcript from Gong
1. Click the **"Add Transcript"** button at the bottom of the transcripts section
2. Click the **"Import from Gong"** tab in the modal
3. You'll see a list of recent calls from the last 90 days

**Search & Filter:**
- Use the search bar to find calls by title, participant, or user
- Click "Filters" to filter by Banner rep, or date range
- The list shows call title, date, duration, participants, and Banner rep

4. Find your call and click the **"Import"** button
5. The system will:
   - Fetch the full transcript from Gong
   - Analyze the conversation using AI
   - Extract stakeholders, pain points, next steps, business areas, MEDDICC info
   - Update the account with all insights
   - Save the transcript with analysis

**This takes 10-30 seconds depending on transcript length.**

### Step 3: Generate Follow-up Email
1. Once the transcript is imported, you'll see it in the transcripts list
2. Each transcript card shows:
   - Call type and date
   - Attendees
   - Summary
   - Next steps
   - Link to review in Gong

3. Click the **"Follow-up Email"** button on the transcript card
4. Wait 5-10 seconds while the AI generates your email
5. The email appears below with:
   - Subject line
   - Professional greeting
   - Recap of discussion points
   - Clear next steps
   - Professional sign-off

**Review and Use:**
- Click **"Copy"** to copy the email to your clipboard
- Paste into Gmail/Outlook and make any minor tweaks
- Send to your prospect

## What Makes This Email Good?

The AI considers:
- **Call context**: What type of call, who attended, what was discussed
- **Account history**: Previous conversations, known pain points, business priorities
- **Stakeholder map**: Decision makers, champions, economic buyers
- **MEDDICC status**: Metrics, decision criteria, gaps we need to fill
- **Next steps**: Commitments made during the call

This creates emails that are:
- ✅ Specific to what was actually discussed (not generic)
- ✅ Tied to their business priorities
- ✅ Move the deal forward with clear next steps
- ✅ Professional and ready to send

## Additional Features

### Generate Meeting Agenda
- Click **"Next Meeting Agenda"** to prepare for your next call
- The AI creates an agenda that:
  - Advances the deal to the next stage
  - Works in questions to fill MEDDICC gaps
  - Addresses open business process questions
  - Includes time allocations and clear objectives

### Get Sales Coaching
- Click **"Sales Coaching"** to get feedback on your call
- The AI provides 3 specific areas for improvement
- Focused on enterprise selling methodology, not basic skills
- Helps you continuously improve your discovery and qualification

### View Full Account Intelligence
Switch between tabs to see:
- **Overview**: Deal stage, last contact, key metrics, priority gaps
- **Transcripts**: All call transcripts with analysis
- **Current State**: Business processes, pain points, capabilities
- **Stakeholders**: Decision makers, champions, org structure
- **Information Gaps**: Missing MEDDICC and business info to gather
- **Content**: Generated emails, agendas, and other sales content

## Tips for Success

1. **Import calls right after they happen** - Context is fresh and you can send follow-ups quickly
2. **Review before sending** - The AI is very good but may need minor tweaks for your specific tone
3. **Use the stakeholder map** - The system tracks who you've talked to and their roles automatically
4. **Fill gaps strategically** - The system identifies what you're missing; work those questions into your next call
5. **Build the account profile** - The more transcripts you add, the smarter the emails become

## FAQs

**Q: Can I edit the generated email?**
A: Yes! Copy it to your clipboard and edit in your email client. The AI provides a strong starting point.

**Q: What if the email isn't quite right?**
A: Click the button again to generate a new version. Each generation considers the same context but may phrase things differently.

**Q: Does this work for all call types?**
A: Yes! Works for intro calls, discovery, demos, pricing, negotiations, and follow-ups.

**Q: What if my call isn't in the Gong list?**
A: You can use the "Paste Transcript" tab to manually paste a transcript from Gong or any other source.

**Q: How does it know about previous conversations?**
A: Every transcript you add builds the account intelligence. The system remembers stakeholders, pain points, metrics, and commitments across all calls.

**Q: Can I use this for accounts with no previous history?**
A: Yes! Even on the first call, it will generate a professional email based on the transcript. It gets better as you add more calls.
